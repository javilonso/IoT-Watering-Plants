My tomato plants need water every day. Before leaving my home for holidays, I decided to create a full autonomous (energy and watering) system for watering my plants.

I don't have a water supply near my plants, so I use a 16L plastic box as water tank. I have enough water for about 10 days.

In order to control the system, I am using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Telegram Bot.

The system is powered by solar panels and batteries. In the picture below you can check the electronics diagram.
